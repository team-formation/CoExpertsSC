gitignore dockerignore probably familiar nthe ignore file allows better control overwriting existing files skip overwrite flag ignore file specify individual files directories ignored useful example want subset generated code nexamples nthe swagger codegen ignore file exist root output directory nupon code generation pass cli option ignore file override path ignore_file greater control generated outputs note complete override override swagger codegen ignore file output directory regenerating code neditor support swagger codegen ignore files available intellij ignore customizing generator nthere different aspects customizing code generator creating modifying templates language supporting configuration file handle different type mappings neach files creates reasonable defaults running quickly want configure package names prefixes model folders use json config file pass values nand config json contains following example nsupported config options different language running config help lang available options options applied configuration file config json passing java jar swagger codegen cli jar optionname optionvalue optionname work open api swagger codegen issues new look noutput nyour config file java look like nfor unspecified options default values nanother way override default options extend config class specific language nto change example prefix objective generated files simply subclass java nand specify classname running generator nyour subclass loaded overrides prefix value superclass bringing models nsometimes want model generated case simply specify import mapping tell nthe codegen create location references specific model nrefer classes note apply languages nto specify import mapping use import mappings argument specify model import logic multiple mappings validating openapi spec nyou options easiest use api validator badge let validate spec debug flag wrong spec example generating dynamic html api documentation nto use dynamic

#*covering proper implementation techniques splash screens android splash screens android table contents introduction basics performing background work gotchas conclusion introduction nat point needing implement splash screen android app reasons include matching existing design ios performing necessary background work start simply visual appeal noted splash screens certainly required app fact screens evil dont use uncommon come android apps utilize splash screen nthis article provides detailed outline implementing splash screen android implementation relatively straight forward details overlooked provided working sample project run device emulator basics nfirst create activity named splashactivity app src main java com ibm mil splashactivity java nit important extend activity exclude actionbar visible splash screen declare splashactivity launcher activity app manifest file app src main androidmanifest xml nour splash screen initial screen shown app launches nthe layout splash screen typically simple purposes imageview center screen app src main res layout activity_splash xml ninside oncreate bundle initialize handler corresponding runnable responsible starting app main activity specified duration app src main java com ibm mil splashactivity java handler android os package easily allows developers utilize message queue thread deal synchronization lower level threading apis java case use handler invoke runnable object later point time main ui thread blocking operations occurring meantime nthe implementation run straightforward app main activity called mainactivity example started intent finish marks splashactivity subsequently removes app stack prevents user seeing splash screen app button nfrom onresume method postdelayed runnable long invoked mhandler passed runnable instance timed delay measured milliseconds enqueue mrunnable thread message queue dequeue execution specified delay app src main java com ibm mil splashactivity java nwe remove mrunnable handler onpause ensure execute splashactivity longer resumed state app src main java com ibm mil splashactivity java noptionally allow user dismiss splash screen prematurely oncreate bundle add onclicklistener root view layout app src main java com ibm mil splashactivity java nnow user taps screen splash screen dismissed wish include functionality body onclick view method private helper method indentical code run runnable nand encompasses necessary components properly implementing basic splash screen section describes additionally perform background work splash screen present performing background work na common approach perform background work start splash screen active helpful data shown home screen needs retrieved network external memory device valid alternative display progress bar dialog indicate user long standing operation performed splash screen inhibits user progress app benefit hiding expensive operations user nfor example let assume wanted download image network user profile image shown home screen create asynctask exactly app src main java com ibm mil imageloader java doinbackground string runs thread performs actual network fetching image onpostexecute bitmap oncancelled run thread imageloader invoked main thread case nfor demonstration purposes written asynctask retrieving image exist perform operation note making network requires internet permission added manifest file nthe basis implementation splash screen identical splash screen developed basics brevity simply extend splashactivity augment oncreate bundle include execution asynctask app src main java com ibm mil java nexecuting imageloader inside oncreate bundle allows background work start soon activity created consequently cancel task ondestroy running order allow operation continue background activity longer visible app src main java com ibm mil java nthat extent performing background work splash screen present section explores pitfalls developers encounter splash screen gotchas nthere handful oversights developers implementing splash screen example sure remove runnable handler onpause effectively restart splash screen duration time onresume called app src main java com ibm mil splashactivity java nif instead moved invocation postdelayed runnable long oncreate bundle bother removing runnable callback onpause runnable end executed app background result mainactivity suddenly appear user screen app longer active state nit important employ handler delay execution code contained runnable app src main java com ibm mil splashactivity java nif main thread sleep order simulate delay user blocked performing ui actions splash screen visible includes button exit app nlikewise essential use asynctask perform background work block main thread increase likelihood anr application responding message shown user happens respond input event minimum seconds dreaded anr dialog nanother consideration asynctask interacts splash screen good approach splash screen remain visible specified duration like basics cancel background task takes long app src main java com ibm mil java nit good idea duration splash screen dependent background work completed types tasks involving network calls undetermined time complete timeout mechanism important conclusion nsplash screens simple surface special consideration order implement properly missing smallest lead poor
