configure nats server configuration file example shown documentation details configuration language ninside configuration files string values support following escape characters xxx note specifying

server servers cluster simply specify seed server server routes option indicated nwhen running nats servers different hosts command line parameters servers simple neven host seed running work server detect attempt connect ignore words command line deployed hosts mesh properly form nnote connect servers seed server server accepting connection inform servers mesh new server connect advantage seed approach deploy configuration hosts node example nthe following example demonstrates run cluster servers host start seed server use command line parameter produce debug information nsee clustered nats examples docker nalternatively use configuration file let seed conf content similar nand start server like nthis produce output similar nit possible specify hostname port independently port required leave hostname bind interfaces nnow let start servers connecting seed server nwhen running host need pick different ports client connections port accept routes cluster note routes points cluster address seed server localhost nhere log produced connects registers route seed server gzm nfrom seed server log route accepted nfinally let start server nagain notice use different client port cluster address point seed server address nats nfirst route created seed server gzm route iye id second server accepted nthe log seed server shows accepted route server nand log second server shows connected nat point mesh cluster nats servers securing nats nthis section describes secure nats server including authentication authorization encryption tls bcrypt authentication nthe nats server supports single multi user client authentication documentation single user authentication nfor single user authentication start nats server authentication enabled passing required credentials command line nyou enable single user authentication set credentials server configuration file follows nclients connect token based authentication na token unique identifier application requesting connect nats start nats server authentication enabled passing required token command line nyou enable token based authentication set credentials server configuration file follows nclients connect encrypting passwords tokens npasswords tokens ideally encrypted bcrypt configuration file store password token use mkpasswd utility encrypt password token use value instead note clients use password token directly connect bcrytped value nto use mkpasswd utility pass parameter mkpasswd utility set password nfor example encrypting cr set authorization server configuration nif want mkpasswd utility generate password token run parameter multi user authentication nyou enable multi user authentication nats server configuration file defines user credentials user password optionally permissions users multi user authentication leverages variables nfor example authorization nthe nats server supports authorization subject level permissions user basis permission based authorization available authentication documentation nbefore server possible define permissions allowing authenticated user publish subscribe certain subjects starting possible define permissions denying right publish subscribe specific subjects neach permission grant object fields subject authenticated user allowed denied right publish subject authenticated user allowed denied right subscribe parser generous understanding intent arrays singletons processed subjects contain wildcards permissions use variables nyou set permissions creating entry inside authorization configuration block conforms following syntax nnote old definition supported absence allow deny means allow permission nhere example authorization configuration defines users assigned explicit permissions nsince joe admin publish subscribe subject use wildcard match subject nalice requestor publish requests subjects req foo req bar subscribe response ncharlie permissions granted inherits default permission set set inherited default permissions assigning entry inside authorization configuration block nbob responder alice requests bob needs able subscribe request subjects respond alice reply subject nimportant note order break request reply patterns need add rules alice bob pattern unauthorized client publishes attempts subscribe subject allow list deny list action fails logged server error message returned client nmost time fine specify subjects user allowed publish subscribe nhowever instances easier configure subjects user allowed publish subscribe note allow clause required absent means user allowed publish subscribe nhere example showing use allow deny clauses nthe configuration means user myuser allowed publish subjects tokens allow subjects matching sys bar baz foo user subscribe subjects matching foo subject bar foo baz nwithout deny clause explicitly list subjects user publish subscribe ones deny list prove difficult set size huge authorization clustering nthe nats server supports route permissions route permissions define subjects imported exported individual servers cluster permissions defined cluster configuration import export clauses enables variety use cases allowing configurations enforce directional flow messages allow subset data nthe following server configurations restrict messages flow servers allow na directional flow messages edge server cloud server nthe example allows request reply messages published subject matching global freely propagated cluster cloud server imports locally delivers messages published subjects matching sensors export messages published subjects matching sensors enforces directional flow sensor data edge servers cloud servers new edge servers added receive sensor data edge servers importing exporting subjects server clustering provide additional security optimize use network resources note introduced permissions block defined authorization block forcing cluster user defined order permissions work nthis changed permissions block moved level cluster
